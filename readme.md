## Description

***A modern classic stack***

Ok Boomers !

We worked so hard to be comfortable in our old slippers and now the kids are trying to change our old ways with their javascripting nonsense.

Bring back the good old stuff ! 

This package helps you scaffold your application with jQuery, bootstrap and laravel blade authentification.

Comes with vite or webpack with **hot reload** !!!

Embrace the ease and comfort of your old dusty stack with the power of the modern web with one free and easy to use package.

composer require mikehins/pepperidge

```bash
php artisan pepperidge:remembers
```

```
